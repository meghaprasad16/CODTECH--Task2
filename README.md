## Overview of the Project
## Project: BMI TRACKER APP
## Objective
Develop an app that calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight.
### Key Activities
A BMI Calculator accepts the weight and height of an individual and calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of that person.
We generally use the Body Mass Index in order to categorize people on the basis of their height and weight. These categories are underweight, healthy, overweight, and even obesity.
The following table shows how the classification of BMI is done in order to identify the health status of a person.

S. No. 	  BMI	           Weight Status
1	      Below 18.5	    Underweight
2	      18.5 - 24.9	    Normal
3	      25.0 - 29.9	    Overweight
4	      30.0 and above	Obese

we have defined two variables as the_height and the_weight which uses the input() function to accept input from the user. We have also included the float() function outside the input() function in order to convert the input string into the float data type so that we can perform calculations with it.
Next, we will calculate the Body Mass Index.We will use the following formula in order to calculate BMI.
BMI = (weight (kg))/(height(m))^2
